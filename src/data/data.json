At a later stage in her career she decided to learn programming and web development, that requires a lot of guts! She is energetic and always seeks to learn more about programming and how to get better at her work. She jumps happily on any task given with a determined mind to solve it as soon as possible. I have no doubt, with that determination, that she will succeed to become a great developer."
