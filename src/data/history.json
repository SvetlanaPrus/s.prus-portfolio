  "text": "Working as software engineer was my dream when I graduated from university. But life does not go as we imagine. Technologies were not yet very developed at that time. There was the 1998 economic crisis and little work. I was lucky. Having lived all my life near the sea, it was hard to give up a career in the maritime industry. I started my journey in a new ship design engineering centre that just opened. It was required technical knowledge and skills, communication skills, working with documentation and an advanced computer programs software. The biggest bonus of my job was working on challenging and interesting projects with my colleagues from Lithuania and Denmark. In 2009, I changed my job, continuing to work in the maritime industry. But, again, life does not go as we expect. The crisis of 2014-2016 fundamentally and forever changed my life.\n \n My interest in calculations, standards and partly in programming has led me to another path of my career I never imagined - accounting. In 2018 I completed the relevant course and worked at a small consulting company for about 1.5 years. I learned a lot. It helped me well understand the internal processes and financial aspects of business. The fact that I take a long-term approach, I constantly asked myself if this was the path I still wanted to take. I kept exploring alternative solutions.\n \n I wanted to fundamentally shift my career to the IT-industry and knew it was not going to be easy. What is the gap between where I am and where I want to be? I started small.\n \n …\n \n Fast forward, I currently (November '22) work at Itera Norge AS as Frontend Developer (Trainee). I am very impressed by colleagues, projects, the company’s vision and passion, and more important – by empowering women in IT.\n \n"
